## Overview

In the final project, I imported the R built-in dataset **mtcars**.

- The user is instructed to enclose some data points from the graph in order to have a subset which will be modeled with a line.
- The results of the model, namely the slope and the intercept of the line, are shown on the side panel and can be dynamically changed.

## Preview of the data

```{r mtcars, echo = TRUE}
head(mtcars)
```

We want to see how the weight of the car influences its miles per gallon. If the car has more weight, it should travel fewer miles with one gallon of gas.

##

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Weight (1000 lbs)", ylab = "Miles per gallon")
model <- lm(mpg~wt, data = mtcars)
abline(model, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
print(model$coefficients)
```
